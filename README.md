apns2-spdy

Documentation and use of APIs with examples is exactly same as apns2
https://www.npmjs.com/package/apns2

The http2 client used in the implementation is node-spdy https://github.com/indutny/node-spdy instead of node-http2 used in apns2.
In personal point of view node-spdy is way stable than node-http2 as far as h2 implementation is concerned.
